# **Biomarker Discovery for Early Cancer Detection of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma (PAAD)**

## 1. **Project Objective**

In this project, RNA-seq data for pancreatic cancer (PAAD) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was analyzed to identify potential biomarkers for early cancer detection. This project focuses on finding genes that are significantly expressed in early-stage pancreatic cancer samples compared to normal samples.
